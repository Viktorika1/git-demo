sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field
sword and spear
wall of shields
sword and spear
wall of shields
Born from silence, silence full of it
A perfect concert my best friend
So much to live for, so much to die for
If only my heart had a home
