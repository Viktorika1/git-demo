sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field


"If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it
Remember only the verse, songmaker's cry the one without tears
For I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.
Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality
where being wanted became a thrill I never knew
The sweet piano writing down my life"
sword and spear
wall of shields
sword and spear
wall of shields
Born from silence, silence full of it
A perfect concert my best friend
So much to live for, so much to die for
If only my heart had a home


"If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it
Remember only the verse, songmaker's cry the one without tears
For I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.
Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality
where being wanted became a thrill I never knew
The sweet piano writing down my life"
